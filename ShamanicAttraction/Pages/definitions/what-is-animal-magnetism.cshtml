<h1>What is Animal Magnetism?</h1>
<p class="blue">Definition: Personal Sexual Attractiveness or Raw Charisma.</p>
<p>Several factors affect a person's presence and raw charisma:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Presence "in the moment"</li>
    <li>Energetic connection to the Earth's sexual energy</li>
    <li>Energetic connection to the Universe's love energy</li>
    <li>The amount of fears and blockages in the person's energy field</li>
</ul>
<p>
    All these factors alter a person's aura and energy field and people intuitively feel it. Emotions are
    contagious. People feel good around someone who lives vibrantly and feel bad around someone who lives
    fearfully. Women are generally ten times more intuitive than men.
</p>
<p>
    Many other factors define a person's <a href="what-is-charisma">charisma</a>. Animal magnetism refers
    only to the continuous non-verbal communication and flow of energy.
</p>
<p class="blue">Physics of Emotional Communication</p>
<p>
    The main argument against emotional communication is the belief that we are isolated systems and the
    empirical <b>law of conservation of energy</b>.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>: <i>
        "The
        law of conservation of energy is an empirical law of physics. It states that the total amount of energy
        in an <b><u>isolated system</u></b> remains constant over time (is said to be conserved over time).
        A consequence of this law is that energy can neither be created nor destroyed: it can only be transformed
        from one state to another. The only thing that can happen to energy in a closed system is that it can
        change form: for instance chemical energy can become kinetic energy."
    </i>
</p>
<p>This law applies only to <b>isolated systems</b>.</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolated_system" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>: <i>
        "<b>
            <u>
                Truly
                isolated physical systems do not exist in reality
            </u>
        </b> (except perhaps for the universe as a whole),
        because, for example, there is always gravity between a system with mass and masses elsewhere. However,
        real systems may behave nearly as an isolated system for finite (possibly very long) times. The concept
        of an isolated system can serve as a useful model approximating many real-world situations."
    </i>
</p>
<p>The law of conservation of energy doesn't apply to real life.</p>
<p>
    <b>
        The law of conservation of energy is useful to elaborate mathematical models but doesn't define the
        boundaries of what is possible.
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    If we want to find how emotional communication fits into the laws of physics, we have to look at what
    is present everywhere in the Universe. The void makes 96% of the mass of the Universe (which is called
    Dark Matter and Dark Energy because physicists don't understand it) and 99.99999% of the volume of our
    atoms. The void is omnipresent on all levels. Once we start studying the structure of the void, we realize
    this omnipresent field is inter-connected like a web, which people call Unified Field, Akashic Records
    or God.

<p class="blue">Energy Dynamics</p>
<p>
    Animal magnetism is a passive and constant flow of energy. Unlike the law of attraction which is about
    consciously and actively attracting something specific, animal magnetism is chaotic, persistent, passive
    and unpredictable. It is a constant sexual presence that makes people feel good, that attracts women
    and that heals.
</p>
<p>
    Your energy is grounded up to Universal love energy and down to the Earth's sexual energy which are the
    two fundamental energies of human existence. You find love and sexual energies from within you through
    these groundings. The energy then shines around you creating a bright aura and making people around
    you feel good. This gives you a charismatic and magnetic presence as people like being around you and
    want to spend more time around you, especially the opposite gender.
</p>
<p>
    When a person of the opposite gender feels your energy, your emotional authenticity and positive feelings
    are transferred to that person who then starts feeling good and whose sexuality starts to blossom. This
    creates a genuine sexual attraction that goes beyond reason and the rational mind has limited power
    over nature. This also creates instant emotional intimacy and chemistry.
</p>
<p>
    In terms of sexual attraction, you can view animal magnetism as a magnet. The stronger the magnet, the
    more it attracts magnets of opposite polarity. The more magnetized and authentic opposite polarities
    will be the most attracted and will create the strongest chemistry.

    Various healing arts such as <a href="https://www.spiritualselftransformation.com/definitions/what-is-alchemy">Alchemy</a> and Reiki increase the flow of energy
    in your body which indirectly enhances animal magnetism. The eBook "<a href="~/sexual-magnetism">
        Sexual
        Magnetism
    </a>" also explains how to develop your animal magnetism and how to apply it to your life.
    Go get that, while it's still fresh in your mind, to start enjoying the benefits right away!
